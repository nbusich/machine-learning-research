srun - submits job and adds to queue, the job is interactive, so it runs in terminal. Useful for Python
    To start session from login:
        srun [options] [command]
    Example: srun job running on 1 node with 1 task:
        srun -N 1 -n 1 -p short -pty bash
    Where:
        n, --ntasks=<number>: specify the number of tasks
        N, --nodes=<minnodes[-maxnodes]>: specify the number of nodes
        p, --partition=<partition-name>: specify a partition for the job to run on
sbatch - submits job and adds to queue for passive execution

sinfo - shows information about all partitions in cluster, name, nodes, status
sinfo -p <partition_name> - shows info about specific partition: e.g. partition_name = short, gpu, or long
squeue - monitor state of jobs in queue
squeue -u <username> - monitors state of jobs for specific user
scancel <jobid> - cancels specific job


job-assist - helps make running jobs with srun and sbatch easier

    Default: Quickly start job with default settings
    Interactive: submits interactive job with custom resource requests
    Batch: generate and save sbatch scripts
